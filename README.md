# instagram_unfollower
Unfollow public Instagram accounts which do not follow your account

# limitations:
- Instagram imposes certain limits on actions like following and unfollowing to prevent spam or misuse. If you’ve reached your daily or hourly unfollow limit, you won’t be able to unfollow additional accounts until the limit resets.
- If you’re following a large number of accounts compared to your followers, you may be temporarily restricted from unfollowing more accounts.
- If you’ve reached your daily or hourly unfollow limit, you will need to wait until the limit resets. Instagram’s limits can vary, so be patient.
- Avoid following significantly more accounts than the number of followers you have. Keeping a balanced follower-to-following ratio can help prevent action blocks.
